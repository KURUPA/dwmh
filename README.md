The ocarina icon was drawn with inspiration from the Ocarina Mod by bobafettlink and pretty much every other presentation of an ocarina that I could find on the internet. The carrot texture was modified from the vanilla carrot texture in colour by me, and then given beautiful animation by AranaiRa. See CREDITS.
