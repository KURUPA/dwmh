# CREDITS

See CREDITS for full information. Textures are by myself, improved by AranaiRa.

# USAGE

You are responsible for where you summon your steeds. There is no in-built check to ensure that horses are teleported to safe locations, so if you are standing near lava: summoner beware! For full usage information and instructions, including recipes, see the CurseForge page.
